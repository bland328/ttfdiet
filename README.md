Introduction
------------
'TTF DIacritics Encoding Tool' applies a diet to a .ttf font: it modernizes
the way in which glyphs for precomposed Unicode characters are stored in
a TrueType-flavored OpenType font, and reduces the font's file size.

Disclaimer
----------
The tool is EXPERIMENTAL and intended for experienced font developers.

It is intended to create fonts that:

* demonstrate the file size reduction that can be achieved by
  an optimization method similar to the one used by the tool,
* test the level of applications' basic OTL support, most notably for
  'ccmp' decomposition and 'mark'/'mkmk' attachment. To test OTL support,
  install a dieted font and type a precomposed character such "?", "?", etc.

This tool is NOT intended to produce shipping-quality fonts.

Requirements
------------
1. The tool requires Python 2.6 or newer and the fontTools/TTX package from:
   https://github.com/behdad/fonttools/
2. inputfont must be a TrueType-flavored (.ttf) fonts that contains
   a 'glyf' table. It does NOT work with CFF-flavored .otf fonts.
3. inputfont should contain a 'GSUB' table.
4. inputfont should contain combining marks (U+03xx) which should be assigned
   to the mark class (3) in the 'GDEF' table.
5. inputfont should contain a 'mark' GPOS feature that positions the combining
   mark glyphs over base glyphs.
6. Installing ot-sanitise from https://github.com/khaledhosny/ots is recommended.

Diet
----
The tool applies a 'diet' to a .ttf font. The diet consists of two steps:

1. It 'blanks' all glyphs that, in the 'cmap' table, represent precomposed
   Unicode characters (such as U+00E1, LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE),
   i.e. it removes all contours and components for those glyphs from the
   'glyf' table (note: the tool cannot process the 'CFF' table).
2. It adds a 'GSUB' lookup that substitutes every glyph that represents
   a precomposed Unicode character with a sequence of glyphs that represent
   the Unicode canonical decomposition of that precomposed character,
   and adds the lookup to the 'ccmp' feature.
3. The tool attempts to run OTS (ot-sanitise), an open-source tool. Please
   check the results. If ot-sanitise fails, the font may not reliably work
   in web browsers.

Usage
-----
```
Usage: python ttfdiet.py [options] inputfont.ttf [outputfont.ttf]

The tool has a number of options, which are listed below.
To enable an option, specify it with the value 1.
To disable an option, specify it with the value 0.
Not specified options will use the default values shown below.

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v 0, --verbose=0     print additional information during processing

  File handling:
    -f 0, --fea=0       save 'ccmp' feature in AFDKO-syntax .fea file
    -S 0, --sanitise=0  skip font considered invalid by 'ot-sanitise' (if OTS
                        is available)

  Core diet options:
    -g 1, --glyf=1      remove components and contours from precomposed glyphs
    -k 1, --kern=1      remove precomposed glyphs from 'GPOS' kern
                        PairPosFormat1 subtables
    -C 1, --ccmp=1      add 'ccmp' subtable that decomposes precomposed glyphs
    -s list, --skipmarks=list
                        do not process precomposed glyphs involving these
                        marks; default list is
                        031B,0321,0322,0334,0335,0336,0337,0338
    -a 0, --repmarks=0  report marks missing in font that would allow a better
                        diet

  Additional diet options:
    -c 1, --cmap=1      remove all 'cmap' subtables except Windows-platform
    -n 1, --name=1      remove all 'name' records except Windows-platform
    -p 1, --post=1      remove 'post' glyph names

  Various options:
    -r 1, --rename=1    add 'Diet' prefix to 'name' records (also enables
                        --name)
    -d 0, --dsig=0      add empty 'DSIG' table
